# SyncIt


daemon that synchronizes files with a remote server.


- The "config" file stores the full paths of the files that are to be watched and synced.

- Setup of ssh-key based access to the remote server is required.

- The Daemon watches the files for any changes on regular basis.
( At the moment, the user can manually set it inside the code, I will make it configurable later )
